title: "Infotumori, v2.0 release"

Yesterday I released version 2.0 of [Infotumori.it](https://www.infotumori.it).
I briefly summarize the new features:

1. *search section*: integration with MongoDB database containing a collection of information pages on different types of cancer. For the moment these are only the 10 most statistically prevalent worldwide. Of course, this number will increase over time;
2. dynamic creation of pages from the database: these are not initialized a priori and locally, but are generated dynamically after querying the integrated database;
3. complete redesign.

The project is constantly evolving. It's like a cloud that moves with the wind. My commitment is maximum and I think a lot about what I can implement so that Infotumori can really make a difference. However, it will take a long time. Because I have to take into account my professional and academic commitments. So I am working on a roadmap that I hope to share with you soon.

These are my first steps into healthcare and I am happy to have the opportunity to work on it.

Any feedback is very welcome. Especially constructive criticism. 

Thanks for reading this far.
