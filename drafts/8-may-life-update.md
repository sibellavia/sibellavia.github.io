The more I move forward, the more I realize that I don't want to be in the backsides, doing something that will be marginal or forgotten anyway. I'm convinced that I want to do something that can help people live better. As much as possible, I want to leave a mark. That's why I want to pursue my dream: to join the healthcare industry. I will go forward, no matter what, in order to achieve my goals.

On May 2 I gave a speech. For the first time in my life I spoke to ≈500 people that work in Accenture Technology Italy. I presented my knowledge and two use cases about Agility and DevOps applied on Low-Code platforms. It was a nice experience, I'm sure it enriched me in some way. Sharing is fundamental and knowledge must be shared to see others grow thanks to the time that you dedicate to them.

I'm meeting new people. For the first time in my life I saw the feathers of the poplars flying through the air. It reminded me of the lightness and beauty of life. It made me enjoy a good time.

Stability is everything but even a few stretches of adventure and *insanity* can make us feel alive. I must remember to travel more, to stay hungry (to have an appetite for the good things in life).

I'm really enjoying the gym. Every now and then I get the idea of wanting to do powerlifting. But the road is long, the path is complicated. And I'm looking forward to enjoying it all.

This was a moment of reflection for me. Thank you for reading this far.
