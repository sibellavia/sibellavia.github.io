    <h1>My abilities are tending toward infinity</h1>
    <p>These days I have been thinking a lot about my abilities. During this period, I was more frequently doing things that I did not know how to do completely. I didn&rsquo;t even know them. I found myself in a completely new context, with unfamiliar tools and applications. As has often been the case in my life, I felt overwhelmed at first. The amount of activity was significant and I had to learn new things. A real challenge.</p>
<p>After a while, I expanded both my knowledge and my skills about what I was supposed to do. Day after day, I applied myself and the end result was great. I never thought I would improve so much, to the point of getting extremely positive feedback. Also because I did some activities that I was deeply convinced I was not capable of.</p>
<p>This is where I realized: my abilities are tending toward infinity.</p>
