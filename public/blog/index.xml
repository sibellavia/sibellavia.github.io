RNNs were developed to overcome the limitations of feedforward networks that don&amp;rsquo;t maintain a memory of past information.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a general look at Feedforward Networks, to then better understand RNNs.&#xA;In feedforward networks, input is processed in a single pass, from input to output, without retaining any memory of previous inputs.</description>

      <title>Applying Deep Learning to detect Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</title>

      <description>Retinal detachment is an eye disease and is one of the most serious ocular emergencies. It occurs after a layer of the retina - essential tissue for vision - is lifted from the pigmented epithelial tissue, dragging the blood vessels that supply nutrients and the eye with it. If the retina is no longer nourished through contact with the pigment epithelium layer, cell death and a progressive and functional loss of vision or of the detached portion of the retina occur after 48 hours.</description>

      <description>A Clinical Decision Support System is defined as an &amp;ldquo;active knowledge system, which uses two or more patient data elements to generate case-specific advice&amp;rdquo; (DSS, 2001). This implies that a CDSS is simply a Decision Support System focused on the use of knowledge management in order to obtain clinical advice for patient care based on multiple variables inherent to it. The main purpose of the modern CDSS, therefore, is to assist doctors in patient treatment cases or in emergency situations (Benner, 2007).</description>
