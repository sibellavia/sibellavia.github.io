    Sources https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/ https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Basic-Allocation.html https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=functions-malloc-reserve-storage-block https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs351/slides/slides-malloc.pdf In this article I would like to show you my malloc() implementation from scratch in C. I&rsquo;ll take the chance to show the code step by step and I&rsquo;ll try to cover all the didactical aspects involved.
I&rsquo;m assuming you already know C at an intermediate level, so you already know what pointers are. I&rsquo;m also assuming you&rsquo;re already familiar with the concept of Linked List.

RNNs were developed to overcome the limitations of feedforward networks that don&rsquo;t maintain a memory of past information.
Let&rsquo;s take a general look at Feedforward Networks, to then better understand RNNs.
In feedforward networks, input is processed in a single pass, from input to output, without retaining any memory of previous inputs.
  
    <h2><a href="/i-love-imperfection/">I love imperfection</a></h2>
    Today I made coffee. When it was ready to be poured, I looked at the cups. Among them, I have a broken porcelain cup with the handle missing. I am in love with this cup; I do not even want to repair it. Here I thought, I love imperfection. I love it a little bit in everything: I love imperfection in people, in things. Especially in the process of creation: I&rsquo;m creating something, I&rsquo;m creating it slowly, step by step.
  
    <h2><a href="/my-abilities-are-tending-toward-infinity/">My abilities are tending toward infinity</a></h2>
    These days I have been thinking a lot about my abilities. During this period, I was more frequently doing things that I did not know how to do completely. I didn&rsquo;t even know them. I found myself in a completely new context, with unfamiliar tools and applications. As has often been the case in my life, I felt overwhelmed at first. The amount of activity was significant and I had to learn new things.
  
    <h2><a href="/applying-deep-learning-to-detect-rhegmatogenous-retinal-detachment/">Applying Deep Learning to detect Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</a></h2>
    Retinal detachment is an eye disease and is one of the most serious ocular emergencies. It occurs after a layer of the retina - essential tissue for vision - is lifted from the pigmented epithelial tissue, dragging the blood vessels that supply nutrients and the eye with it. If the retina is no longer nourished through contact with the pigment epithelium layer, cell death and a progressive and functional loss of vision or of the detached portion of the retina occur after 48 hours.
  
    <h2><a href="/a-generic-introduction-to-clinical-decision-support-systems/">A generic introduction to Clinical Decision Support Systems</a></h2>
    A Clinical Decision Support System is defined as an &ldquo;active knowledge system, which uses two or more patient data elements to generate case-specific advice&rdquo; (DSS, 2001). This implies that a CDSS is simply a Decision Support System focused on the use of knowledge management in order to obtain clinical advice for patient care based on multiple variables inherent to it. The main purpose of the modern CDSS, therefore, is to assist doctors in patient treatment cases or in emergency situations (Benner, 2007).
