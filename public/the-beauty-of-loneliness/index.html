    <h1>The beauty of loneliness</h1>
    <p>Too many distractions, a constant need to be with someone because we don&rsquo;t feel good alone. We can&rsquo;t talk to ourselves, sometimes some of our thoughts frighten us. Since I lost my dad, I have become a little more lonely in my life. Unfortunately, no one can fill that void. The truth is, it really doesn&rsquo;t need to be filled! This caused me to be more with myself. At first I hated it. After a while, I really love being alone now, and I&rsquo;m getting so used to it that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be used to having a constant presence in my life. I haven&rsquo;t had any special feelings for anyone for a long time, my focus has shifted to me and it will stay that way for a long time. Now I have a new companion in life: loneliness. And I am so excited to do all the things I want to do! I want to travel, surf more spots, improve myself.</p>
<p>Today I am really at peace with myself.</p>
