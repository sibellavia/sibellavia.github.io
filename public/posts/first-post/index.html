  <section class="post-content"><p><strong>Welcome to my blog!</strong> This is my first post. Here I will drop whatever I find most interesting, or I will simply try to explain some concepts that I find fascinating but unclear. I know, it sounds a bit strange, but they say one of the best ways to learn is to exhibit and illustrate to others.</p>
<p>I made this blog with <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://it.reactjs.org/">React</a>. I also tried <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby.js</a> (it&rsquo;s a great SSG), but I found Next.js more flexible, so I decided to go with it.</p>
<p>My website is quite simple, for two reasons: <strong>I love simplicity and minimalism</strong> (because I am a perfectionist, and if I had to add details I would not have finished anymore and would have entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)">gold-plating phase</a>, absolutely not necessary for my purposes), and <strong>I love to learn new stuff</strong> (I don&rsquo;t currently feel confident with React, so I will use my blog as a great opportunity to improve and add new features gradually).</p>
<p>My greatest passions are programming, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (applied in particular to the field of medicine), Statistics and Biostatistics, Applied Psychology. You can read more about me by <a href="../pages/about">visiting the dedicated page</a>. Hope you find interesting the contents that I will publish. And I apologize in advance if my English is not perfect, I am trying to train my writing skills.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
