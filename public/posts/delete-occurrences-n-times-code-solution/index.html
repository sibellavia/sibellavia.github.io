 Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]." />

  <section class="post-content"><p>Yes, I am enjoying Codewars a lot. Here&rsquo;s another kata:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>delete_nth ([1,1,1,1],2) # return [1,1]</p>
<p>delete_nth ([20,37,20,21],1) # return [20,37,21]</p>
<h2 id="my-solution">My solution</h2>
<p>I used Python in this case too, because I&rsquo;m practicing it.</p>
<p><img src="/delete-occurrences/first-solution.png" alt="first solution."></p>
<p>For this first solution I have initialized two variables, <strong>number_to_check</strong> and <strong>counter</strong>.</p>
<p>I then created two nested for loops. In the first, I scroll through all the integers on the list. At each occurrence, I assign item to number_to_check. Immediately after the assignment, another cycle is started which again runs through all the elements of the list and makes a comparison between the considered value and number_to_check. Here I have inserted some flow controls: trivially, <strong>if the counter is greater than max_e</strong> (the maximum value of the occurrences that an item can have), <strong>then the element is eliminated from the list.</strong> Otherwise the counter increases and the loop continues until the end of the list.</p>
<p>That works, but we can refactor the code to make it leaner. And here comes the second solution.</p>
<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>
<p><img src="/delete-occurrences/second-solution.png" alt="second solution."></p>
<p>Here we initialize <strong>res</strong> as an empty list. In the for loop the magic happens. Thanks to the <strong>count() method</strong> we are able to check if the occurrences of item exceed the maximum index <strong>max_e:</strong> if so, <strong>item</strong> is ignored and we move forward, otherwise <strong>item is added to the res list.</strong> In this way we will have a list in which there will be only elements that do not occur more than n times. Much easier!</p>
<p>Hope you liked it. Thanks for reading and SYL with the next solution.</p>
