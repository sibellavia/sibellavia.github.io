  <p>Today I made coffee. When it was ready to be poured, I looked at the cups. Among them, I have a broken porcelain cup with the handle missing. I am in love with this cup; I do not even want to repair it. Here I thought, I love imperfection. I love it a little bit in everything: I love imperfection in people, in things. Especially in the process of creation: I&rsquo;m creating something, I&rsquo;m creating it slowly, step by step. Yes, it will be imperfect, but I like it precisely because it has parts that can potentially be improved. They can also stay as they are.</p>
<p>Perfection is not our goal, it is our tendency. Then it&rsquo;s to be expected that something won&rsquo;t be perfect, just because of our conviction. The important thing is that there is a commitment on our part.</p>
