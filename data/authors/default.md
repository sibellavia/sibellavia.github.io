Hi there! I am Simone Bellavia, I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Catania, Sicily, a wonderful city overlooking the Ionian Sea and living at the foot of the volcano Etna. I am now based in Milan, another city I love, but I travel all the time. I work full-time as an IT Senior Analyst in Accenture. I study at the University of Milan-Bicocca in the Master of Science in Data Science program. I am a person who is strongly driven by passions and who looks at life with a lot of curiosity.

I work mainly as a Scrum Master and Software Engineer on multiple projects and multiple teams. Web programming and the DevOps world constitute two predominant interests. I enjoy delivering high-quality software, so I also continuously study Technical Agility practices that can help teams perform better. I always tend to be a servant-leader and a point of reference in my teams. I have worked in different industries: currently I am involved in the Energy one for a large Italian multinational, but I have also been in Public Services, Chemical-Cosmetic, Tobacco, and E-Commerce.

I study Data Science because it encompasses many of my passions: programming, math and statistics, business development. My biggest dream is to make my skills available in the healthcare industry, particularly the oncology industry.

In the past I also held a preponderant role as a UX/UI designer: it taught me to love symmetries, well-chosen typographies and good taste in design.

I am in love with the wind, the sea and its waves. In my life I have always practiced Windsurfing and SUP, sports that have taught me so much and continue to do so always.
