Lemon is a modern, general-purpose web server written in Rust. It leverages asynchronous I/O with [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) HTTP library, and [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) for TLS support. The primary design goals are simplicity, efficiency, and ease of configuration.

Lemon is under active development, and it will be for a long time. Enjoy us on our journey.

Lemon is Simone Bellavia's side project.
