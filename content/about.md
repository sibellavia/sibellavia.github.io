Hello there! I'm a result-oriented Business Analyst. In my teams I am a point of reference when it comes to solving a problem or planning tasks to be completed.

I'm currently working as a Business & Integration Arch Analyst at Accenture. I coordinate agile teams and I assist the client to achieve the requirements and objectives set by the project

I am also involved in the design, development and configuration of systems and architectures, making my knowledge of technologies, applications and methodologies available. I have experience in the Energy, Cybersecurity and Hybrid-Cloud Applications, Chemical-Cosmetic and Food sectors.

In the past I took part in FE/BE development projects that required the use of Angular, Vue and React. I worked with microservices structured architectures, integrating a DevSecOps approach.

I have also led marketing, graphic and UX/UI design projects. I love symmetries, well-chosen typographies and good taste.

I am a data lover, and a student of the Master's Degree in Data Science at the University of Trento. I am very interested in Cybersecurity and everything that comes with it. I have a BSc in Psychology.
