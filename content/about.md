Born, raised (and currently based) in Catania, Sicily, a beautiful city overlooking the Ionian Sea and living at the foot of the Mount Etna. *Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to thread*, this is why I love to travel and do it most of the time, both for work and pleasure :) 
I work full-time as a Project Engineering Manager @ Leonardo in awesome international teams, creating value for common society.

I am studying for a MSc in Data Science at the University of Milan-Bicocca. I study AI/ML because it is the perfect synthesis of my main passions: programming, mathematics, statistics, business development. In the past I also had a prominent role as a UX/UI designer: it taught me to love symmetries, well-chosen typographies, and good taste in design.

I am a very passionate person who looks at life with a lot of curiosity.
