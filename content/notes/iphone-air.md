Apple presented the iPhone Air, *the thinnest iPhone ever*. This is the only new release from Apple that got my interest during their presentation event. 

Its design is interesting: the entire logic board and A19 Pro chip are compacted into the camera bump (which includes both front and rear cameras). This iPhone is all battery and screen. IMHO, it seems like a strategic move for the coming years, for which this iPhone Air will serve as an experiment or a launchpad for ultra-thin devices, or simply as a research and development testbed for similar designs that enable powerful yet ultra-compact technologies.

Remarkable factor, iPhone Air has A19 Pro, which is Apple's latest SoC. More in detail: it is built on TSMC's N3P process node, and benefits *from a 20% increase in transistor density compared to its predecessor, the N3E node, according to a 2023 IEEE study on semiconductor scaling*. The A19 Pro features a six-core CPU with two high-performance cores and four efficiency cores, and 5-core GPU. Each GPU core has its own Neural Accelerators, which Apple claimed allows for MacBook Pro-level performance in an iPhone. On the new iPhone Pro, they are even more powerful. If the M5 chip will get this GPU upgrade... well, NVIDIA should start to feel some pressure.   

To summarize: local AI to the Max. Next year, I want local LLMs on my phone.
