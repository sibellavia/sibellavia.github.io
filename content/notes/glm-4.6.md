[GLM 4.6](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6). It's Z.ai new flagship model. It is an update to GLM-4.5 *and reaches near parity with Claude Sonnet 4*.

Major improvement is the longer context window, expanded from 128K to 200K. It also shows significant improvements in coding. Z.ai aims to make it *the best agentic coding model*.

It is available for Claude Code, Opencode, Cline, and many others. Their Lite Plan, costing $3/month, provides up to 120 prompts every 5 hours, which should be about 3x the usage quota of the Claude Pro plan. I'm gonna try it today.

As I did for previous LLM releases on this blog, I won't report the benchmarks but you can consult them on their official blog announcement.
