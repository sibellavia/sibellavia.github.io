I decided to change the template and layout of this site. I often find myself writing short notes very quickly during the day, which don’t always fit the traditional *blog post* format, since they are very brief. Also, I don’t always have the time to write long posts. For this reason, I modified the template to allow me to publish and share short **Notes** (like the one you are reading right now). Of course, I will continue to write and publish **blog Posts** when I have time. 

On top of that, kinoroll.com no longer exists: the domain expired and I don’t intend to renew it. I preferred to move it here, onto my personal site! This way I can centralize everything and not have to manage different sites and domains. So the **Kinoroll** section will show the old kinoroll.com, but from now on I’ll share the links I like, along with some thoughts when possible, in the **Link** section, creating my own personal blogroll.

I hope my blog is easier to navigate now. I was strongly inspired by Simon Willison.
