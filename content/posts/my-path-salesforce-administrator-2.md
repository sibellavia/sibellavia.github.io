In July 2021, I began studying to certify myself as an Administrator on Salesforce. To learn more about my preparation for the exam, [you can read my post about it.](my-path-salesforce-administrator-1) My plan initially was to take the exam next year. But I realized I could take it earlier, and so I did.

On September 30th I took the exam and passed it. I must say that the preparation and the roadmap that I had set myself were very useful. The trailheads that SFDC makes available for free on their site completely cover the requirements of the exam. If you also intend to acquire the Administrator certification, I suggest you do the same. Furthermore, I found it very useful to do mock exams a few weeks before the exam. The questions are very specific and scenario-based, so it's easy to imagine the correct answer. But it is necessary to have a preparation that covers a bit of everything.

That's it. See ya!
