Today I made coffee. When it was ready to be poured, I looked at the cups. Among them, I have a broken porcelain cup with the handle missing. I am in love with this cup; I do not even want to repair it. Here I thought, I love imperfection. I love it a little bit in everything: I love imperfection in people, in things. Especially in the process of creation: I'm creating something, I'm creating it slowly, step by step. Yes, it will be imperfect, but I like it precisely because it has parts that can potentially be improved. They can also stay as they are. 

Perfection is not our goal, it is our tendency. Then it's to be expected that something won't be perfect, just because of our conviction. The important thing is that there is a commitment on our part.
